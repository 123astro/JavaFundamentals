Terms of art

1) method - a block of code that runs when called
2) class - object constructor or blueprint to create an object.
3) function - same as a method but in java we use method to describe a block of code
4) field - holds the data or attributes of an object
5) variable - data container that saves to memory during a java program execution


A class holds methods and field variables. The class is an object constructor.
