Terms of art

1) method - a block of code that runs when called
2) class - object constructor or blueprint to create an object.
3) function - same as a method but in java we use method to describe a block of code
4) field - holds the data or attributes of an object
5) variable - data container that saves to memory during a java program execution


A class holds methods and field variables. The class is an object constructor.

A compiled language (complied into machine language) is a programming language whose implementations are typically
compilers and not interpreters.
An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely,
without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.
